  abstract  = {Invented more than 40 years ago, the two-phase locking concurrency control (2PL) is capable of providing opaque transactions over multiple records. However, classic 2PL can suffer from live-lock and its scalability is low when applied to workloads with a high number of non-disjoint read accesses.In this paper we propose a new 2PL algorithm (2PLSF) which, by utilizing a novel reader-writer lock, provides highly scalable transactions with starvation-freedom guarantees. Our 2PLSF concurrency control can be applied to records, metadata and to indexing data structures used in database management systems (DBMS). In our experiments we show that 2PLSF is often superior to classical 2PL and can surpass concurrency controls with optimistic reads, simultaneously providing high throughput and low latency for disjoint and non-disjoint workloads.},

  abstract   = {To support Hybrid Transaction and Analytical Processing (HTAP), database systems generally rely on Multi-Version Concurrency Control (MVCC). While MVCC elegantly enables lightweight isolation of readers and writers, it also generates outdated tuple versions, which, eventually, have to be reclaimed. Surprisingly, we have found that in HTAP workloads, this reclamation of old versions, i.e., garbage collection, often becomes the performance bottleneck.It turns out that in the presence of long-running queries, state-of-the-art garbage collectors are too coarse-grained. As a consequence, the number of versions grows quickly slowing down the entire system. Moreover, the standard background cleaning approach makes the system vulnerable to sudden spikes in workloads.In this work, we propose a novel garbage collection (GC) approach that prunes obsolete versions eagerly. Its seamless integration into the transaction processing keeps the GC overhead minimal and ensures good scalability. We show that our approach handles mixed workloads well and also speeds up pure OLTP workloads like TPC-C compared to existing state-of-the-art approaches.},

The main contributions of this paper are two lower bound trade offs between the I/O complexity of member queries and insertions: If N < M insertions perform at most δ · N/B I/Os, then (1) there exists a query requiring N/(M. ·~O(δ)) I/Os, and (2) there exists a query requiring Ω(logδlog2N ~ I/Os when δ is O(B/log3 N) and N is at least M2. For both lower bound we describe data structures which give matching upper bounds for a wide range of parameters, thereby showing the lower bounds to be tight within these ranges.},

  abstract   = {A critical aspect of modern key-value stores is the interaction between compaction policy and filters. Aggressive compaction reduces the on-disk footprint of a key-value store and can improve query performance, but can reduce insertion throughput because it is I/O and CPU expensive. Filters can mitigate the query costs of lazy compaction, but only if they fit in RAM, limiting the scalability of queries with lazy compaction. And, with fast storage devices, the CPU costs of querying filters in a lazy compacting system can be significant.In this work, we present Mapped SplinterDB, a key-value store that achieves excellent insertion performance, query performance, space efficiency, and scalability by replacing filters with maplets, space-efficient data structures that act as lossy maps with false positives. Critically, we use quotient maplets, which can be merged and resized without access to the underlying data, enabling us to decouple compaction of the data from compaction of the quotient maplets. Thus Mapped SplinterDB can compact data lazily and quotient maplets aggressively, so that each level has multiple sorted runs of data but only one quotient maplet. Quotient maplets are so small that compacting them aggressively is still cheaper than compacting the (much larger) data lazily, so overall we get the insertion performance of a lazily compacted system. And, since there is only one quotient maplet to query on each level, we get the query performance of an aggressively compacted system. Furthermore, quotient maplets can accelerate queries even when they don't fit in RAM, improving scalability to huge datasets. We also show how to use quotient maplets to estimate when a compaction could resolve a high density of updates, enabling Mapped SplinterDB to perform targeted compactions for space recovery.In our benchmarks, Mapped SplinterDB matches the insertion performance of SplinterDB, a state-of-the-art lazily compacted system, and beats RocksDB, an aggressive compacting system, by up to 9\texttimes{}. On queries, Mapped SplinterDB outperforms SplinterDB and RocksDB by up to 89\% and 83\%, respectively, and scales gracefully to huge datasets. Mapped SplinterDB is able to dynamically trade update performance for space efficiency, resulting in space overheads on update-heavy workloads as low as 15-61\%, whereas RocksDB had 80-117\% and SplinterDB had up to 137\% space overhead.},

The recent advent of Intel Optane DC Persistent Memory Modules (DCPMM) further accelerates this trend. Many new hash table designs have been proposed, but most of them were based on emulation and perform sub-optimally on real PM. They were also piece-wise and partial solutions that side-step many important properties, in particular good scalability, high load factor and instant recovery.We present Dash, a holistic approach to building dynamic and scalable hash tables on real PM hardware with all the aforementioned properties. Based on Dash, we adapted two popular dynamic hashing schemes (extendible hashing and linear hashing). On a 24-core machine with Intel Optane DCPMM, we show that compared to state-of-the-art, Dash-enabled hash tables can achieve up to ∼3.9\texttimes{} higher performance with up to over 90\% load factor and an instant recovery time of 57ms regardless of data size.},

  abstract  = {This paper presents DLHT, a concurrent in-memory hashtable. Despite efforts to optimize hashtables, that go as far as sacrificing core functionality, state-of-the-art designs still incur multiple memory accesses per request and block request processing in three cases. First, most hashtables block while waiting for data to be retrieved from memory. Second, open-addressing designs, which represent the current state-of-the-art, either cannot free index slots on deletes or must block all requests to do so. Third, index resizes block every request until all objects are copied to the new index. Defying folklore wisdom, DLHT forgoes open-addressing and adopts a fully-featured and memory-aware closed-addressing design based on bounded cache-line-chaining. This design offers (1) lock-free operations and deletes that free slots instantly, (2) completes most requests with a single memory access, (3) utilizes software prefetching to hide memory latencies, and (4) employs a novel non-blocking and parallel resizing. In a commodity server and a memory-resident workload, DLHT surpasses 1.6B requests per second and provides 3.5\texttimes{} (12\texttimes{}) the throughput of the state-of-the-art closed-addressing (open-addressing) resizable hashtable on Gets (Deletes).},

  abstract   = {High-performance transaction system applications typically insert rows in a History table to provide an activity trace; at the same time the transaction system generates log records for purposes of system recovery. Both types of generated information can benefit from efficient indexing. An example in a well-known setting is the TPC-A benchmark application, modified to support efficient queries on the history for account activity for specific accounts. This requires an index by account-id on the fast-growing History table. Unfortunately, standard disk-based index structures such as the B-tree will effectively double the I/O cost of the transaction to maintain an index such as this in real time, increasing the total system cost up to fifty percent. Clearly a method for maintaining a real-time index at low cost is desirable. The log-structured mergetree (LSM-tree) is a disk-based data structure designed to provide low-cost indexing for a file experiencing a high rate of record inserts (and deletes) over an extended period. The LSM-tree uses an algorithm that defers and batches index changes, cascading the changes from a memory-based component through one or more disk components in an efficient manner reminiscent of merge sort. During this process all index values are continuously accessible to retrievals (aside from very short locking periods), either through the memory component or one of the disk components. The algorithm has greatly reduced disk arm movements compared to a traditional access methods such as B-trees, and will improve cost-performance in domains where disk arm costs for inserts with traditional access methods overwhelm storage media costs. The LSM-tree approach also generalizes to operations other than insert and delete. However, indexed finds requiring immediate response will lose I/O efficiency in some cases, so the LSM-tree is most useful in applications where index inserts are more common than finds that retrieve the entries. This seems to be a common property for history tables and log files, for example. The conclusions of Sect. 6 compare the hybrid use of memory and disk components in the LSM-tree access method with the commonly understood advantage of the hybrid method to buffer disk pages in memory.},

  abstract  = {We present pessimistic locking and optimistic reading (PLOR), a hybrid concurrency control protocol for in-memory transaction systems that delivers high throughput and low tail latency. PLOR is especially designed for high-contention workloads: for high throughput, transactions are allowed to access records without being blocked by lock conflicts in the read phase; for low tail latency, conflict detection is delayed to the commit phase, where old transactions are always committed first using the timestamps in the lock. We demonstrate the efficacy of this approach under a variety of setups (e.g., stored-procedures, interactive mode, and persistent logging, etc.). Experiments show that PLOR delivers close or comparable throughput to that of Silo and TicToc in stored-procedures, while reducing 99.9th percentile latency by 8.8x to 14.5x. In the interactive processing mode, PLOR even achieves up to 2x higher throughput.},

  abstract   = {Transaction priority is a critical feature for real-world database systems. Under high contention, certain classes of transactions should be given a higher chance to commit than others. Such a prioritization mechanism is commonly implemented in locking-based concurrency control protocols as some lock scheduling mechanisms, but it is rarely supported in the world of optimistic concurrency control.We present Polaris, an optimistic concurrency control protocol that supports multiple priority levels. To enforce priority, Polaris introduces a minimal amount of pessimism through a lightweight reservation mechanism. The protocol is fully optimistic among transactions within the same priority level and preserves the high throughput advantage of optimistic protocols. Our evaluation with YCSB workload shows that Polaris can make the p999 tail latency of high-priority transactions 13x lower than that of low-priority ones. With an abort-aware priority assignment policy, Polaris can deliver 1.9x higher throughput and 17x lower tail latency compared to Silo for high-contention workloads.},

  abstract   = {Distributed transactions suffer from poor performance due to two major limiting factors. First, distributed transactions suffer from high latency because each of their accesses to remote data incurs a long network delay. Second, this high latency increases the likelihood of contention among distributed transactions, leading to high abort rates and low performance.We present Sundial, an in-memory distributed optimistic concurrency control protocol that addresses these two limitations. First, to reduce the transaction abort rate, Sundial dynamically determines the logical order among transactions at runtime, based on their data access patterns. Sundial achieves this by applying logical leases to each data element, which allows the database to dynamically calculate a transaction's logical commit timestamp. Second, to reduce the overhead of remote data accesses, Sundial allows the database to cache remote data in a server's local main memory and maintains cache coherence. With logical leases, Sundial integrates concurrency control and cache coherence into a simple unified protocol. We evaluate Sundial against state-of-the-art distributed concurrency control protocols. Sundial outperforms the next-best protocol by up to 57\% under high contention. Sundial's caching scheme improves performance by up to 4.6\texttimes{} in workloads with high access skew.},

  abstract  = {Amazon Aurora is a relational database service for OLTP workloads offered as part of Amazon Web Services (AWS). In this paper, we describe the architecture of Aurora and the design considerations leading to that architecture. We believe the central constraint in high throughput data processing has moved from compute and storage to the network. Aurora brings a novel architecture to the relational database to address this constraint, most notably by pushing redo processing to a multi-tenant scale-out storage service, purpose-built for Aurora. We describe how doing so not only reduces network traffic, but also allows for fast crash recovery, failovers to replicas without loss of data, and fault-tolerant, self-healing storage. We then describe how Aurora achieves consensus on durable state across numerous storage nodes using an efficient asynchronous scheme, avoiding expensive and chatty recovery protocols. Finally, having operated Aurora as a production service for over 18 months, we share the lessons we have learnt from our customers on what modern cloud applications expect from databases.},

  abstract  = {Multi-version concurrency control (MVCC) is currently the most popular transaction management scheme in modern database management systems (DBMSs). Although MVCC was discovered in the late 1970s, it is used in almost every major relational DBMS released in the last decade. Maintaining multiple versions of data potentially increases parallelism without sacrificing serializability when processing transactions. But scaling MVCC in a multi-core and in-memory setting is non-trivial: when there are a large number of threads running in parallel, the synchronization overhead can outweigh the benefits of multi-versioning.To understand how MVCC perform when processing transactions in modern hardware settings, we conduct an extensive study of the scheme's four key design decisions: concurrency control protocol, version storage, garbage collection, and index management. We implemented state-of-the-art variants of all of these in an in-memory DBMS and evaluated them using OLTP workloads. Our analysis identifies the fundamental bottlenecks of each design choice.},
